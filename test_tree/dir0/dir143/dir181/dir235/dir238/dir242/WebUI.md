If you press the send-button the form-data are converted to a _GraphQL-Query_ in the background. It is sended and you get the result as json. You also can introspect the _GraphQL-Query_, send the query to the _GraphiQL-Console_ for better formatting and changing the query with the help of the _GraphiQl-console_. You also have the possibility to clear the whole form.


## Hash Query
Here you can enter a _file-hash_. If it is in the database, you get all informations about that file. You get all meta-data. Also you get some informations about the _path_ and the _crawl_, which scanned the file.

## GraphQl-Query
Here you can enter _GraphQL-Code_ and execute it. The result is in json.

# GraphiQl
## GraphiQl-Console
Here you can use the _GraphiQl-Console_. It's a editor, where you can enter your GraphQl-Code. Its highlighted.
More options you have there:

* **You can re-exucute old queries. They are cached locally on your computer.**
* **Pretify your entered graphql-code.**
* **Execute the graphql-code and get the result as json.**

More informations about GraphQl and GraphiQL you can find in the [server-section](https://github.com/amos-project2/metadata-hub/wiki/Server).
